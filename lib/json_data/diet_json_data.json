    "description01": "In the first month of pregnancy your baby is an embryo consisting of two layers of cells. All the organs and body parts will develop from here. This month, the neural tube is developed which is the reason a supplement containing folic acid (or folinic acid or 5-MTHF if you know that you have an MTHFR gene mutation) is crucial to prevent neural tube defects.",
    "description02": "Morning sickness is common in the first few months of pregnancy. It is not experienced by all women, but can be extremely severe for some. The good news is that most women find their nausea disappears by the beginning of their second trimester. In the meantime, here are some strategies to decrease nausea (which can occur at any time of the day, not just in the morning): \n  i) Have a carbohydrate-rich snack 15-20 minutes before you get out of bed in the morning - this can help to settle the stomach before you start to move about. Try storing some plain crackers or bread by your bed for when you wake up. \n  ii) Consume smaller meals, more frequently (i.e. 6 meals a day, rather than 3). Don-t let yourself get too hungry between meals. \n  iii) Focus on foods that are easy to digest. \n  iv) Try to consume liquids between meals rather than with food. \n  v) Stay away from high fat, fried and spicy foods as these can aggravate nausea. \n  vi) Sip plain soda water throughout the day when you feel nauseous",
    "description03": "Folate-rich foods: green leafy vegetables (spinach, rocket, parsley), whole-grains and legumes (lentils, beans, chickpeas). \nVitamin B6: 40 mg taken twice daily has been shown to be an effective, natural treatment at reducing early pregnancy nausea and vomiting. Talk to your healthcare provider about taking this supplement if you feel it might be useful.",

    "description03": "Iron-rich foods: your blood volume is rapidly increasing (and will increase by 50% by the time you give birth). Increase your intake of good quality proteins like eggs and free-range meats (organic/grass fed where possible). If you are vegetarian, make sure you are consuming iron-rich plant foods such as leafy greens and legumes with every meal, along with a source of vitamin C (such as a squeeze of lemon juice or some capsicum/peppers) as this enhances the body's uptake of iron from non-animal sources. Iron deficiency during pregnancy can cause fatigue for the mother and low birth weight, iron-deficient infants so keep on top of your iron intake, or talk to your healthcare provider about supplementation if this might be an issue or you have been feeling very fatigued.",

    "description02": "1) Hunger often increases this month. While you do need more calories to support your rapidly growing baby, make sure to choose nutrient-dense rather than calorie-dense foods to give you and your baby optimal nutrients for growth. \n2) Constipation is common around this time. Constipation commonly occurs during pregnancy as the body is literally slowing down the speed to digestion to ensure maximum uptake of nutrients to support the growth of your baby. Therefore, focussing on a whole food, nutrient-dense diet will likely prevent constipation as the body's nutritional needs are being met. If you do struggle with constipation, focus on getting plenty of whole-grains, fibre-rich vegetables, fruits and legumes, as well as drinking enough water throughout the day.",
    "description03": "Whole-grains, fruits, vegetables and legumes to prevent constipation. Aim for 25-30g fibre each day.

Low protein diets can increase the chances of the baby developing high blood pressure later in life, so it is crucial that you are consuming enough good quality protein.",

    "description03": "1) Garlic: “high” garlic intake during the final month of pregnancy has been correlated with a significantly reduced risk of preterm labour. This is thought to be related to the antimicrobial properties of garlic, which help to reduce infections of the urinary and genital tract, which can increase premature delivery. The best part? “High” intake of garlic in this study equated to 1 single garlic clove per week - pretty manageable!. \n2) Dates: consumption of 6 dates daily for the final 4 weeks before the estimated due date was found to dramatically increase the chances of spontaneous labour (i.e. reduce the need to be induced), encourage greater cervical dilation, faster first stage of labour and decreased need for medical and pharmaceutical intervention. Another more recent study confirmed the results of the earlier study and concluded that “dates consumption in late pregnancy is a safe supplement to be considered as it reduced the need for labour intervention without any adverse effect on the mother and child”. Try snacking on fresh dates throughout the day or use in cooking as a delicious natural sweetener. \n3) Raisins: an intake of around 2 handfuls of dried raisins per week has been correlated with a reduction in chances of premature labour, demonstrating a similar effect to garlic Try snacking on raisins as well, or add to salads or rice dishes for a sweet flavour burst",
